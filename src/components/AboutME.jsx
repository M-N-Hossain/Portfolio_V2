          I'm a determined Bangladeshi fellow following my dream to be an efficient
          software developer. With a passion for coding, I've honed my skills in
          Java, JavaScript, and TypeScript and I'm well-equipped with frameworks
          like Spring Boot, React, React Native, and Express.js in the Node
          environment. The best qualities I have are being a quick learner,
          a hardworking person, and dedicated toward my responsibilities.
          Because of my unwavering passion for technology, I
          am always ready to learn and explore technologies and my hardworking
          mindset allows me to adapt and manage any situation openly.
